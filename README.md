## Code Snippets
![Code Ex](./Assets/Images/snippet1.png)

This section of code is using Math floor and random to pick a random location in the array. Math random chooses a random number between 0 and 1 then that is mulitplied by array length
and rounded down by math floor. Doing this will pick any position inside the array. The counter i being used will repeat this process until it gets to the value of password length the user entered.
